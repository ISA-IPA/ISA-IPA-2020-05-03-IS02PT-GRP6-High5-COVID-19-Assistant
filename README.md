# SECTION 1 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries since December 2019 \cite{callaway2020time}.
 
Many countries have restricted residents from public social interaction. The Singapore government has extended Circuit Breaker \cite{circuitbreaker} to bring down community cases. Most people will stay at home to avoid potential risks. At the same time, they still need to get the updated information about COVID-19.

Although news and dashboards about COVID-19 are flooded through different web pages, to quickly get a personalized summary from a reliable source can still be a challenge. 

Our team designed a system which can retrieve COVID-19 data and provide users based on their preferences. NUS students and staff could also provide the body temperature to our system and it will automatically update to NUS Daily Temperature Declaration website. This greatly reduces usersâ€™ time on login and body temperature input everyday.
